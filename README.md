## ✅ Next Steps

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create two new repositories:
   - `cprogram-assignment`
   - `cprogram-class-files`

2. Inside each folder on your laptop, run:
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git

    Add the README.md file and push your code:

echo "# Title" > README.md   # (or paste the content above)
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
